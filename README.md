This project is a sentiment analysis and popularity prediction system for Taylor Swift songs. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of song comments and predict the popularity of songs based on their sentiment scores. The project consists of two scripts: the first script loads song comments, computes sentiment vectors, and predicts song impact, while the second script uses the predicted impact to train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict song popularity.
